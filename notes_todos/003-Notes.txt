1. We will fetch data from the DB.
 - We will use doctrine to get Todo records from the database. So we have to include the class with use.
 - We pass the $todos array to our view for rendering

 - In our index.html.twig file we loop through our records to display our records.

2. When we click on Add Todo in the nav-bar, we are redirected the create page which contains a form to create a new Todo item. Most of the Form creation is done in the createAction of the TodoController.



2. When we click on a edit, we are redirected to the /todo/edit route.
