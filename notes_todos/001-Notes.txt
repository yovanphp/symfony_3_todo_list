1. In the first video the tutor showed us how to map our site with the host file.
TODO: See this video and set it up.

2. app/config contains our applications configurations
For example app/config/parameters.yml contains our database and mail settings.

app/config/routing.yml defines our routing parameters.
It defines the resource: "@AppBundle/Controller", so the resource for our controllers are found in the folder src/AppBundle/Controller and we will use annotations to define our routes.

3. app/Resources contains the views folder
		app/Resources/views contains the 
		 - default/index.html.twig file which is the default welcome screen we get when we run the app for the first time after installation.
		 - base.html.twig file which is the layout file - It surrounds our views.
		 {% block body %}{% endblock %} => This is where our views are replaced.

Twig is the default templating engin that Symfony uses.

4. We will never work in bin but we use the command php bin/console server:run localhost:8080 to start the built-in PHP server.

5. src contains our bundles - isolated reusable code
   - controller/DefaultController.php has an indexAction, with a request parameter.
   It finally renders our view, the index template.
 	/**
     * @Route("/", name="homepage")
     */
    
    This means that the route for our indexAction is / and internally we can reference the route using homepage

   - The src folder will also contain our model entities here (we will create a folder for them).


 6. As our app is a small app, we will use the AppBundle for our demo app's bundle.

 a. Create a controller in the AppBundle/Controller folder called TodoController and copy the code of the DefaultController.
 	- Rename the class and define the route as :

 	/**
     * @Route("/todos", name="todo_list")
     */
    public function indexAction(Request $request)
    {
    	//This is for testing
        //die('Yovan is rocking');
        // replace this example code with whatever you need
        return $this->render('todo/index.html.twig');
    }

    - This implies that our indexAction points to /todos and we internally can reference the route using todo_list.
    We can change the name of our indexAction to listAction and this will still work.
    
    Recap: As we saw previously, in the app/config/routing.yml, we have defined our resource, so Symfony knows where to search for our controllers.
    
    - The page to be rendered is todo/index.html.twig and we don't need any values that we wan to pass to our view.
	As we have not created our view yet for testing purposes we can use die('The todo list is shown successfully'); and navigate to localhost:8080/todos

    - Create our index.html.twig view in app/Resources/views/todo/ new folder.

    - We create our create, edit and details view and add the corresponding actions in our TodoController.
